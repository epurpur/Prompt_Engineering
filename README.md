# Prompt Engineering in AI with the CLEAR Framework


## **About Me**
Erich Purpur

    Research Librarian for Science & Engineering

I'm a part of a group called [research data services](https://data.library.virginia.edu/) and I do these things:
    
    1. Serve as Liaison to various departments in the sciences & engineering
    2. Teach workshops and classes (like this one)
    3. Help people with research projects
    4. Random other things as they come up

## Prompt Engineering 
The process of crafting effecting inputs to guide large language models and other AI systems towards generating desired outputs. AI tools like ChatGPT, CoPilot, etc. create output based on predicting the most likely sequence of words based on patterns they've learned from huge sets of training data. They predict these patterns using statistical methods. It is easy to get generative AI tools to produce an output. That is what they are meant to do. However, that output can be misleading, off target, untruthful, too long, too short, not specific, or otherwise non-optimized in many ways. Through effective prompt engineering you can get better outputs! 

## AI Resources at UVA
### [Microsoft Copilot Login]([UVA ITS](https://virginia.service-now.com/its?id=itsweb_kb_article&sys_id=dbe41947dbe3f91066d98f38139619db))

While most of this material is available to anyone, whether you are a part of the University of Virginia or not, these resources are available to UVA-affiliated people through our ITS department. UVA ITS maintains a page with up-to-date information of their current AI offerings, found [here](https://virginia.service-now.com/its?id=itsweb_kb_article&sys_id=dbe41947dbe3f91066d98f38139619db).

UVA is a Microsoft Campus and for that reason, I will be teaching this workshop using Microsoft's Generative AI tool, Copilot. However, results should be very similar using any other AI chatbot tool such as ChatGPT, Gemini, etc. 

**Disclaimer**
If you are a UVA-affiliated person, make sure to log into Copilot through the [UVA ITS](https://virginia.service-now.com/its?id=itsweb_kb_article&sys_id=dbe41947dbe3f91066d98f38139619db) portal. Because UVA has a site license with Microsoft, UVA's instance of Copilot will protect personal information, your chat history, etc.
