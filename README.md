I'm a part of a group called [research data services](https://data.library.virginia.edu/) and I do these things:
    
    1. Serve as Liaison to various departments in the sciences & engineering
    2. Teach workshops and classes (like this one)
    3. Help people with research projects
    4. Random other things as they come up

## Prompt Engineering 
The process of crafting effecting inputs to guide large language models and other AI systems towards generating desired outputs. AI tools like ChatGPT, CoPilot, etc. create output based on predicting the most likely sequence of words based on patterns they've learned from huge sets of training data. They predict these patterns using statistical methods. It is easy to get generative AI tools to produce an output. That is what they are meant to do. However, that output can be misleading, off target, untruthful, too long, too short, not specific, or otherwise non-optimized in many ways. Through effective prompt engineering you can get better outputs!

While most of this material is available to anyone, whether you are a part of the University of Virginia or not, these resources are available to UVA-affiliated people through our ITS department. UVA ITS maintains a page with up-to-date information of their current AI offerings, found [here](https://virginia.service-now.com/its?id=itsweb_kb_article&sys_id=dbe41947dbe3f91066d98f38139619db).

UVA is a Microsoft Campus and for that reason, I will be teaching this workshop using Microsoft's Generative AI tool, Copilot. However, results should be very similar using any other AI chatbot tool such as ChatGPT, Gemini, etc. 

**Disclaimer**
If you are a UVA-affiliated person, make sure to log into Copilot through the [UVA ITS](https://virginia.service-now.com/its?id=itsweb_kb_article&sys_id=dbe41947dbe3f91066d98f38139619db) portal. Because UVA has a site license with Microsoft, UVA's instance of Copilot will protect personal information, your chat history, etc.

## The CLEAR Path: A Framework for Prompt Engineering
When AI chatbots like ChatGPT came into the fold in 2022, there was a flurry of activity to explore these tools and see what they can do. While they create new opportunities, like any tool it is more powerful when wielded correctly. If you don't know how to drive a car, you might crash into a ditch? AI tools also have their own best practices, though there is no AI-tool users license. So what is the right way to use them?

In 2023, UVA Library Dean [Leo Lo](https://library.virginia.edu/news/2025/leo-lo-named-uva-librarian-and-dean-libraries) published the article: [The CLEAR path: A framework for enhancing information literacy through prompt engineering](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0099133323000599). This article is a logically organized method for interacting with AI chatbots in order to get the best results possible. When writing prompts, the five points to keep in mind are...


| Letter   | Description |
| -------- | ------- |
| C | Concise. Brevity and Clarity in prompts               |
| L | Logical. Structured and coherent prompts              |
| E | Explicit. Clear output specifications                 |
| A | Adaptive. Flexibility and customization in prompts    |
| R | Reflective. Continuous evaluation and improvement of prompts    |

#### C. Concise
Brevity is important in crafting prompts. A concise prompt removes superfluous information and allows the LLM to focus on the most important aspects of a prompt. Clarity is important as unclear instructions may result in bad responses. Writing effective prompts requires ensuring that the question is specific and directed toward the desired response.

*Example:* Please provide me with an extensive discussion on the factors that contributed to the economic growth of China during the last few decades.
*Improvement:* Identify factors behind China's recent economic growth. 

#### L. Logical
Logical prompts enables AI models to better comprehend the context and relationships between various concepts, resulting in more accurate and coherent outputs. Ensure that the information provided follows a natural progression and that the relationship between concepts are evident.

*Example:* I am learning about the scientific method and don't know how to go about conducting a scientific experiment. How do I do that?
*Improvement:* Describe the steps in the scientific method, starting with forming a hypothesis and ending with drawing a conclusion.

#### E. Explicit
Explicit prompts underscore the need for clear output specifications in the queries posed to AI language models. Explicit prompts provide precise instructions regarding the desired output format, content, or scope, thereby reducing the likelihood of receiving unanticipated or irrelevant responses from the AI model. 

*Example:* Tell me about the French Revolution
*Improvement:* Provide a short overview of the French Revolution, emphasizing its causes, major events, and consequences. 

#### A. Adaptability
Adaptability entails experimenting with various prompt formulations, phrasing, and settings (if available) in order to establish a balance between creativity and concentration. When crafting prompts, be flexible and willing to attempts new approaches based on the performance of the model. 

*Example:* If the results of a prompt such as "Discuss the impact of social media on mental health" is too general, consider a more focused and adaptable prompt
*Improvement:* Examine the relationship between social media usage and anxiety in adolescents

#### R. Reflective
Adopting a reflective perspective puts gives users agency to evaluate the performance of the AI model, identifying areas for improvement and adjusting their approach accordingly. Make it a habit to examine the AI-generated content and apply insights to future prompts. This includes fact checking! Be aware that the AI doesn't always know what it is talking about and don't accept it's answers as truth.
